# Rise-of-the-Hero
This was our first-semester group project.
# Project Description
This project is a website development-based project. It contains all the information about our C++ project in the Programming Fundamentals course. The website contains detail about the game, characters, and team members and it even has links to download the game.
# How to download and play the game:
Download the whole website folder and run the 'index.html' file. Once opened, on the navbar, there would be a download button, press it. And again there would be a download button on the main part of that web page, click it. Once the folder is downloaded. Open the 'game1.sln' file and run it. And enjoy gaming!
# Note:
Screenshots have been added for a first look.
